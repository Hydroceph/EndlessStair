# EndlessStair



## Getting started

To run the game, you must first install the following into the same VENV:
• Python 3.11+ (developed on 3.11.4 and presented on 3.12.5)
• Pygame
• Pathfinding3d (which will also install numpy for you)

All of which can be done with pip, or another installation method of your choice.

Successfully running the game is sensitive to the active directory. When opening the containing
folder in VSCode (or code editor of your choice) be sure to open the parent folder containing the
folder named ‘code’, NOT the folder named ‘code’ itself. Then, navigate into the ‘code’ folder, then
into ‘main.py’, and then run the game.

Controls are:
• w,a,s,d for movement
• LShift, Spacebar and mouse for attacks
• H to start (from start screen)
• L to turn off the lighting effect
• T to start dialogue (press only once when in front of NPC), G to continue dialogue
• Y to open upgrade menu
• P to commence finding a pathfinding path for the boss enemy

# Please only press ‘p’ when in the final room with the boss enemy, or an error will occur.

# Please only press ‘t’ to start dialogue once, or a permanent dialogue box will appear until game
restart.
